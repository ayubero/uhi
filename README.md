# UHI

The purpose of this project is to automatically detect Urban Heat Islands (UHI) in cities using satellite imagery and open data.

## Installation

This project uses poetry to manage its dependencies, so just run `poetry install --no-root` to install all dependencies mentioned in pyproject.toml. After that, execute `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment.

## Image download

In `src/download/sentinel.py`, the constant `product_url` is defined based on [this documentation](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/OData.html) to locate any product in the Copernicus OData API. Adjust this constant according to your search requirements.

Ensure you have a `.env` file in the scripts folder to store the **ACCESS_TOKEN** and **SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**. These credentials can be generated by following [this guide](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/S3.html), allowing you to download images from the Copernicus S3 endpoint.
